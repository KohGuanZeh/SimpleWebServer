# Simple Web Server

The goal of the project is to build a simple web server that follows the [HTTP 1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945) protocol that is to be hosted on Windows environment. The language of choice for this project is `C`, given my lack of experience in low level languages and my desire to learn more about low level programming and concepts.
